# üå± Restake//Regen


An Eigenlayer AVS public good that allows Ethereum validators to pledge their commitment to offset a fraction of the network's carbon emissions by pledging to purchase and retire high-quality carbon credits.

*For the Eth Global Sydney Hackathon*</sub>

### üåè Overview 1

Protocols like Celo [can claim to be carbon neutral](https://blog.celo.org/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490) because the protocol itself takes a small cut of every block rewards which goes to a carbon offset fund.

---

### üåè Overview 2

Ethereum's move to proof-of-stake (POS) cut its energy use by over [8000x](https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/), however the POS network has a network of over 1 Million lightweight validator nodes running various hardware, emitting roughly [2,000 Tonnes of CO2 annually across the network](https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/ethereum/ghg). 

---

### üåè Overview 3

We can implement carbon offsetting on Ethereum using [Eigenlayer restaking and slashing mechanisms](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/ycie/) by defining an AVS (Actively Validated Service) that enforces opterators to pledge to subsidise their carbon emissions from running a node by retiring high quality [Toucan Biochar (CHAR) carbon credits](https://app.toucan.earth/) on Base L2.

---

### Why Restake//Regen?

Validators have compelling reasons to pledge towards carbon neutrality or even negativity, including:
1. Risk Management
2. Cash Flow: Allows validators to amortise their carbon emission costs monthly rather than a one-off multi-year commitment.
3. Differentiation and Competitive Advantage
4. Meeting Social pressure and personal ethics
5. Long term viability of the Ethereum Network
7. Airdrop Farming

### Ethereum's Carbon Footprint
![emissions_and_validators](https://github.com/willemolding/Restake-Regen/blob/main/assets/figures/emissions_per_validator_singleplot.png?raw=true)

The number of validators and overall energy use is not constant over time and we can assume that the network carbon output will continue to go up in the future due to no maximum validator cap. 

---

![emissions_per_validator](https://github.com/willemolding/Restake-Regen/blob/main/assets/figures/emissions_per_validator_epoch.png?raw=true)

We use a Chainlink AnyAPI Oracle to distribute monthly carbon emissions of Ethereum on chain to Restake//Regen.

Single validator carbon emissions have dropped from ~4kg CO2 / validator / epoch in April 2023, to ~1kg CO2 in April 2024

Showing the network and global energy mix is greening over time.

---

These offset numbers are negligable per validator, and we propose that operators may opt-in to 1x, 5x, 10x, 100x, 1000x or 10,000x (roughly ~0.0001-1% of the total network) of their emissions to help green the network.

## Toucan CHAR Carbon Credits
Toucan is a trusted carbon credit cryptocurrency and recently released high quality [CHAR](https://app.toucan.earth/) credits on Base L2 in March 2024, currently priced at ~$160 USD (May 4, 2024).
At todays price, the total Ethereum annual network carbon cost equates to: 
- $320,000 per year
- <32c per validator per year, or
- ~2c per validator per 28 day epoch.

## Restake//Regen System Components

![Restake-Regen Network Architecture](https://github.com/willemolding/Restake-Regen/blob/main/assets/figures/network_diagram.excalidraw.svg?raw=True)

---

*DELETE*
There are three main components to the Restake//Regen AVS: 
1. Restake//Regen AVS (Ethereum L1)
2. Chainlink AnyAPI Oracle: Provides live carbon emissions estimates (Ethereum L1)
3. Funding Pool (Base L2)

---

### Chainlink Cross Chain Interoperability (CCIP)
We use the Chainlink CCIP to send Challenge and Pledge receipt messages between Ethereum L1 and Base L2. 

---

### Worldcoin ID Points System
We use Worldcoin Proof of Personhood for Sybil restistance to our non-linear Net Zero Points system.


$$NetZeroPoints = SignupBonus+\int_{t_{signup}}^t stake\ out$$

### The AVS Slashing flow (from Base Sepolia to Sepolia)

1. Whistleblower calls contract on Base Sepolia passing epoch and operator address they want to attempt to slash
2. contract reads from storage the amount that operator deposited for the given epoch.
3. This is sent to the CCIP router with the target address given as our ChallengeManager contract on Sepolia L1
4. CCIP receiver calls into our L1 slasher contract with the "evidence". `ChallengeManager` contract checks if this constitutes a slashable offence (e.g. epoch has ended, amount is less than pledged by validator) and slashes the given validators staked Ethereum if they did not meet their pledge.

---

### Summary

Restake//Regen is an AVS which allows operators to sign up to pledge their commitment to a particular fraction of the total network carbon emissions.

Toucan CHAR is the high quality credit of choice, and we hope to eventually offset the entire 2,000T CO2 of annual Ethereum carbon emissions.


---

## Contracts Summary

---

### EigenLayer AVS
- Basic Setup to run the full Eigenlayer stack

---

### Pledge Registry
- Sign up to the AVS
- Opt-in to a specific % of the Ethereum network (between 0.0001% and 1%)

---

### Service Manager
A minimal interface to be an Eigenlayer AVS

---

### Challenge Manager
Allows anyone to challenge if an operator has not made their pledged CHAR retirements and allows an operator to cancel a challenge via CCIP. Calls into ServiceManager to perform slashing.
 - Currently using a constant 2000T CO2/yr, but
 - Hope to use Chainlink AnyAPI connection with the CBNSI Web2 API. 

---

### Funding Pool (Base L2)
 - `Contribute`
Allows operators to call the `Contribute` function to add CHAR tokens to the Funding Pool, and get a receipt for these CHAR tokens being retired on behalf of a operator. These tokens are pooled before burning (CHAR retirement must be in 1T increments). The Funding Pool then Stores the retirement and allows proofs of this contribution to be sent to L1, as to clear any challenges at a later date

---

### Funding Pool (Base L2)

- `Challenge`
Allows anyone, such as a whistleblower, to claim that an operator did not make their pledged commitment in a previous epoch, by checking the Retirement Receipts. Invokes the L1 Challenge Manager.
- `Retire`
Allows anyone to retire the entire FundingPool CHAR credits (Minimum 1T)
- `Retirement Receipts`
Storage of operator contribution receipts, to be used during Challenge acted on L1.
