# üå± Restake//Regen

üß† An Eigenlayer AVS that allows Ethereum validators to offset their energy usage by committing to buying and retiring carbon credits.

## Overview

üåè Despite Ethereums move to proof-of-stake cutting its energy use by over [8000x](https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/), eth still has a network of over 1,000,000 lightweight nodes running varying hardware, emitting roughly [2,000 Tonnes of CO2 annually](https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/ethereum/ghg). 

Protocols like Celo [can claim to be carbon neutral](https://blog.celo.org/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490) because the protocol itself takes a small cut of every block rewards that goes to a carbon offset fund.

Adding this to Ethereum is impossible without a hard-fork however we can get a similar result using Eigenlayer restaking and slashing mechanisms by defining an AVS (Actively Validated Service) that enforces their commitment to subsidising the energy usage of running a node by retiring high quality[ Toucan Biochar (CHAR) carbon credits](https://app.toucan.earth/) on BASE.

Validators opt-in to the AVS and then each epoch (28 days with 13 months a year per the [International Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar)) they must send the required amount of CHAR to the Restake//Regen funding contract, which is then bulk offsetted by an open contract call. The offset amount required is defined by a custom [Chainlink Any API](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/get-request/examples/array-response#example) oracle linked to the [Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index API]( https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/ethereum/ghg).


A validator must contribute in a block within each epoch, and a recipt of this proof is stored in the funding pool. At any time, anyone (whistleblower) can challenge a validator through the Funding Pool, and claim they didn't make their promised contribution. If the validator did contribute, the receipt is checked and they wont be slashed. If there is no receipt or they cannot provide a proof within the alloted time, they are slashed by the AVS.
